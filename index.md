**April 17**

## Basic Tips

- For clickable events - use an `a` tag or `button` rather than a div. Using the correct HTML element means that keyboard users can easily tab through your content, and are able to "click" on items without using a mouse.
- It's important to style the `:focus` state of your clickable elements. This makes it obvious to keyboard (and all) users that a particular element is active.
