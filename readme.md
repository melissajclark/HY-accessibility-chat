## Basic Tips

- For clickable events - use an `a` tag or `button` rather than a div. Using the correct HTML element means that keyboard users can easily tab through your content, and are able to "click" on items without using a mouse.
- It's important to style the `:focus` state of your clickable elements. This makes it obvious to keyboard (and all) users that a particular element is active.  
- Use a font-size of at least 16px
- When creating forms, do not use the `placeholder` attribute as the label. 

## Background Info
- There are 1.8 million people with disabilities in Ontario _(- Jonny)_

    - "Matt Wilcox asked “I still don’t bother with <header> <footer> etc. I assume all widely used browsers support them now. But, do they do anything more than div?”. It’s a good question. The answer I gave is “yes”. These two elements (and <nav> and <main>) give value to users of some assistive technologies on some browsers."
